# Disaster-Response-Pipeline-Project
This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree 

## Installations:
  - Install:
    - Anconda
    - nltk
    
          in the notebook use this command to install it:
          nltk.download()
        
    
    
  - using the following Packeges:
    - pandas
    - plotly
    - Flask
    - sqlalchemy
    - nltk
    - json
    - pickle
## Project Motivation:
   #### As Part of the Data science Nanodegree. I used the Figure Eight Data for disaster data.This project will show off software skills, including the ability to create basic data pipelines and write clean, organized code!
   ###  Three component:
   #### ETL Pipeline:
   - Merges the two datasets.
   - Cleans the data.
   - Stores it in a SQLite database.
   #### ML Pipeline:
   - Loads data from the SQLite database
   - Splits the dataset into training and test sets
   - Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
   - Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
   - Outputs results on the test set
   - Exports the final model as a pickle file
   #### Flask Web App
